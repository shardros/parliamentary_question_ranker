1,"To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, whether his Department has made an estimate of the quantity of (a) commercial forest timber and (b) waste wood products that will be needed to achieve the government’s target of 1.5million homes in this parliament; and what proportion of these products can be sourced domestically.","<p>We do not yet have an estimate of the required timber and waste wood required to meet the Government's housing targets. The current forecast of softwood availability for Great Britain is a total average of 25.2 million cubic metres of softwood timber per annum over 50 years (2013-16 to 2057-61) from public and private estates.</p><p> </p><p>We are aiming to increase softwoods to at least 30% of total planting and bring more hardwoods to market through increased woodland management. To support this goal, the Government launched the Timber in Construction Roadmap on 27 February 2025 which sets out our vision for a sustainable, integrated industry that meets the needs of the future.</p>",1589.679789390357,3,1582.1456954898392,1778363
2,"To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, what steps his Department is taking to negotiate a veterinary agreement with the European Union to ensure the continued supply of veterinary medicines to Northern Ireland beyond December 2025; and what alternative solutions are being considered to mitigate potential supply chain disruptions.","<p>Maintaining availability of veterinary medicines to Northern Ireland after the end of 2025 is a priority. This Government continues to progress work on this issue as quickly as possible and we continue to engage with industry to understand their intentions for supply after the grace period and what alternative products could be available. The Government has seen positive signs that the size of the issue is reducing, as businesses are making changes to their operations. The Veterinary Medicines Working Group, including experts, industry representatives and elected representatives, has also been re-established to advise the Government on this matter.</p><p> </p><p>The Government is committed to resetting our EU relationship, including by seeking to negotiate an SPS agreement. We have been clear that an SPS agreement could boost trade and deliver significant benefits on both sides. We will not be providing a running commentary on discussions with the EU and it is too early to comment on what may be in scope of an agreement.</p>",1569.3566180443504,4,1570.1448548905832,1779473
3,"To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, what steps his Department plans to take to support farmers to produce more home grown wheat while meeting (a) net zero targets, (b) the targets outlined in the Environment Act 2021 and (c) other environmental commitments.","<p>The Government is committed to reducing emissions in the farming sector. The transition goes hand in hand with food security and farm productivity. For wheat in 2023, the UK was 96% self-sufficient. We will support farmers to adopt low carbon farming practices, increasing the carbon stored on their land while boosting profitability.</p><p> </p><p>Defra’s flagship crop breeding programme, the crop Genetic Improvement Networks (GINs), funds research to develop crop varieties that are more productive; sustainable; and have greater resilience against a changing climate, including drought tolerance. The latest investment - £15 million over 5 years - covers five crop types, including wheat. The GINs have already successfully identified genetic traits to improve resilience to climate change and common pests and diseases; and the programme is working closely with breeders to incorporate these traits into UK crop varieties.</p><p> </p><p>On 25 February the legislation needed to implement the Precision Breeding Act for plants in England was laid in Parliament and through a new Farming Innovation Programme thematic competition, we have announced £12.5 million to help deliver the practical benefits of precision breeding technology to farmers. This will help transform the plant breeding sector, including potentially supporting more drought resilient cereals.</p>",1564.0296454964673,16,1451.706484772019,1779471

5,"To ask the Secretary of State for Business and Trade, if he will take steps with Cabinet colleagues to reduce imports of software and hardware for key industries from countries that may pose a risk to national security.",<p>Our import controls and sanctions regimes play an important role in supporting the UK's foreign policy and national security objectives including by restricting the import of controlled goods from any source country and specified goods from those countries subject to UK sanctions.</p><p>The Government does not speculate on future import controls or sanctions as to do so could reduce their impact. We continue to monitor the effectiveness of our import controls and the sanctions regime.</p>,1562.564363715397,8,1503.8690503283233,1779795
6,"To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, what steps his Department is taking to reduce UK reliance on imported wheat for milling.","<p>British farmers are world-leaders and know their own land best - carefully planning their planting to suit the weather, their soil type, and their long-term agronomic strategy. Harvested production of wheat in 2023 was just under 13.9 million tonnes, which represents average UK production.</p><p> </p><p>Food security is built on supply from diverse sources, strong domestic production as well as imports through stable trade routes. UK consumers have access through international trade to food products that cannot be produced here, or at least not on a year-round basis. This supplements domestic production and ensures that any disruption from risks such as adverse weather or disease does not affect the UK's overall security of supply. In 2023, domestically produced wheat accounted for 83% of the wheat used in the milling grist. Due to environmental and climate conditions the UK milling industry require a certain level of imports of high protein milling wheat year on year to meet consumer demand.</p>",1526.6319169915582,19,1416.1139642846285,1779472

We are reviewing policies to address the challenges associated with tackling food waste in the supply chain and we are working with businesses, including supermarkets, to drive down food waste and make sure food is put on the plates of those in greatest need. This includes supporting surplus food redistribution to charities and programmes to help citizens reduce their food waste.</p>",1520.208559740878,14,1467.6023078796427,1779296
8,"To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, what proportion of food procured by the public sector in Derbyshire is from British farmers.","<p>As part of the Government’s New Deal for Farmers, it was announced that, where possible, we will back British produce, including that grown in Derbyshire. Over the next year, for the first time ever, the Government will review food currently bought in the public sector and where it is bought from. This work will start right away and be a significant first step in understanding how to capitalise on the Government’s purchasing power: informing any changes to public sector food procurement policies in due course.</p>",1516.3009211334386,12,1492.4086470159955,1779492

This formula was introduced in 2013-14 and is based on the 2013 population projections from the 2011 census data. The formula also includes other variables that have a population measure in them such as density and sparsity which uses a mix of 2001 and 2011 census data.</p><p>The previous government committed to improving and updating the way in which local authorities are funded through the “Fair Funding Review” but this was not delivered. We will make good on this commitment and implement long-awaited reforms through a multi-year settlement in 2026-27.</p><p>As a core part of this plan, the government is committed to introducing an improved and updated approach to funding local authorities from 2026-27 and endeavours to use the most up to date data as part of the fundamental improvements we will make.</p>",1513.8938010538325,6,1518.0377705216902,1778921
10,"To ask the Secretary of State for Housing, Communities and Local Government, whether she plans to include provisions in the English Devolution Bill on improving the provision of support to low-income households to access public services.","<p>The English Devolution Bill will deliver on the vision set out in the English Devolution White Paper, published in December 2024. This included a role for Strategic Authorities in convening partners and driving cross-cutting public service reform, including looking at areas such as multiple disadvantage.
